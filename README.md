## Notes

### Time
I spent all the provided time, only had a lunch break.
I stopped doing the tasks at about 17:35 to wrap everything up and write the final pull request.
Also I planned to spent the last minutes to write this documentation :)

### What would I improve
If I would've had more time, I would have:

- Reworked the User Story 2, to implement a input which let's the user define tasks he already did in the past.
- Also I would've rendered the current task input conditionally, so it only is visible, when the Timer stops.
- Spend more time on styling
- Refactor the code, so the TimeTracker component isn't as crowded with functions.
- Could have built more separate components for the TimeTracker

### Challenges
The most challenging for me was actually getting the time Tracker functionality right. I used up a lot of time on researching and trying out the best way to build such a component.

### Happy/Unhappy
I'm quite satisfied with what I achieved so far. In it's core it's a working app :)
Not so happy about my time management, especially writing this documentation.
